# IMDb Sentiment Analysis - Technical Details

## Deep Dive Analysis

### What I Learned (Detailed)
- **Advanced NLP**: TF-IDF optimization, sequence padding, word embeddings (100-dim)
- **Model Architecture**: CNN outperformed LSTM (90.34% vs 89.28% accuracy)  
- **Performance Tuning**: Early stopping, dropout (0.5), L2 regularization
- **Production Deployment**: Flask + Docker containerization, model serialization

### Technical Challenges Solved
- **Memory Management**: Optimized TF-IDF for 50K reviews Ã— 10K features
- **TensorFlow Compatibility**: Resolved Keras import issues across versions
- **Model Serving**: Implemented proper error handling and prediction pipeline
- **Cross-platform**: Ensured Windows/Linux compatibility

## Performance Analysis

| Model | Accuracy | Training Time | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------------|--------|
| Logistic Regression | 89.66% | 2.3s | Fast, efficient |
| CNN | **90.34%** | 285.7s | Best performance |
| LSTM | 89.28% | 423.1s | Sequential modeling |

### Key Insights:
- **Traditional ML** surprisingly competitive with deep learning
- **CNN** best for sentiment analysis (better than LSTM)
- **Training efficiency** varies dramatically (2.3s vs 423s)

## Limitations & Future Work

**Current**: Binary classification, English only, movie domain  
**Next Steps**: Multi-class sentiment, BERT integration, cross-domain testing
